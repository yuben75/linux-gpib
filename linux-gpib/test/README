libgpib_test is used by developers to test the library, feel free to add
tests for untested functions.  It requires two gpib boards to be installed
in the computer, on the same GPIB bus.  Exactly one of which is the system
controller.

libgpib_test can be run with the -d or --daemonize option, which will
cause it to become a daemon before running the tests (there have
been problems with the linux-gpib use of pthreads breaking
fork).
