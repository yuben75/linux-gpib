libgpib_test is used by developers to test the library, feel free to add
tests for untested functions.  It requires two gpib boards on the same GPIB
bus, exactly one of which is the system controller.  Two instances of
libgpib_test must be run, one with the --master option and one with
--slave.  Start the slave first.

Example:
On computer with slave gpib board, run

./libgpib_test --slave --pad 10

Then on computer with bus master gpib board, run

./libgpib_test --master --pad 10

Options:

-n, --num_loops N
	loop through tests N times
-d, --daemonize [N]
	daemonize after Nth loop
-m, --master
	Use bus master gpib board
-S, --slave
	Use slave gpib board
-p, --pad N
	For master, open device with primary address N.  For slave,
	sets board's primary address to N.
-s, --sad
	For master, open device with secondary address N.  For slave,
	sets board's secondary address to N.  N must be in the range
	[0, 30].  If this option is not specified, then secondary
	addressing is disabled.
-v, --verbose
	Produce verbose debugging output (doesn't do much yet).
