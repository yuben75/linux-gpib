      This is Linux-GPIB the IEEE-488 card support
      package and measurement suite for LINUX.

      It is based on the 2.05-alpha release from the Linux Lab
      Project, which was maintained by C. Schroeter.  However,
      The package was left unmaintained for a couple years so
      I (Frank Hess) decided to pick it up and port it to the 
      2.4 Linux kernel.
