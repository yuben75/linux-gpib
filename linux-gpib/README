=====================================================

This is Linux-GPIB the IEEE-488 card support
package and measurement suite for LINUX.

It is based on the 2.05-alpha release from the Linux Lab
Project, which was maintained by C. Schroeter.  However,
the package was left unmaintained for a couple years so
I (Frank Hess) decided to pick it up and port it to the
2.4 Linux kernel.
