Linux GPIB Package changelog

3.0.0: Completed first pass at port to 2.4 kernel, and cleaned up a lot of little things. 
	Still needs a lot of work, but should have all the capabilities/limitations
	of version 2.05-alpha which it was based on. 

3.0.1: (in progress) Fixed installation of gpib0.o module.  Fixed driver module for use
	with kernels that use module versioning.  Got rid of all usage of pointers to
	store io addresses.
