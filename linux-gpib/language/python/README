This is a python GPIB interface to use gpib library calls from python language.
(Quick hacked)

Installation:

'make' then 'make install'

To use the GPIB extension directly the call syntax is similar as in the C library:

  ##
  # Include the GPIB extension
  ##
  import gpib

  ##
  # find & initialize the device
  ##
  device = gpib.find("my_device")
  
  ##
  # write a string to the device
  ##
  gpib.write(device,"A Command_String")

  ##
  # read a 25 byte string
  ##
  result = gpib.read(device,25)

  print 'the result is: ' + result

To use the Gpib Class module see gpibtest.py


Have Fun!
