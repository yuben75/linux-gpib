Support for the pcIIa board is included in this
package.

Configuring your card:
------------------------

There are two different boards supported: the pcII and the 
pcIIa boards. The newer version of the pcIIa can be jumpered to
pcII mode -- that means backward compatibility to the older pcII
boards with nec7210 (useful for vanilla nec7210 boards :-) ).

The other difference between PCII and PCIIa is the port address
space. PCIIa uses the most significant 6 bits for decoding
nec7210 register set and 'base adress'. 

With PCIIa board you have to select your base address with 
two A13 A14 jumpers the resulting adresses are:
                            
                             A14    A13
                  -------------------------
                  0x02e1     0      0      (default)
                  0x22e1     0      1
                  0x42e1     1      0
                  0x62e1     1      1

Please configure your library to the desired address.
For example

                base=0x02e1

if you want to use the default base address.

  Carles Perello did much work porting and testing the pcIIa driver.
  Many thanks to Ed Clarke for his old PCIIa board :-).
