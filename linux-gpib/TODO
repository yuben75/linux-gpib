cleanup and improve organization of code - lots of work to do here

generally make this software suck less

fix crash on pcmcia card removal when program has board open

have library parse dmesg automatically on error

report error when user tries to read/write to interface board which is
bus master

a kcontrol module for configuring boards might be nice

fix parallel poll timeouts

possible problems when autopoll happens without remote enable

timeouts on read/write should handle data that was able to be
received/sent before timeout occurred.

stuck SRQ handling

add query to ibask() for support of IFC events

fix support parallel poll timeout support (should be hardware-based)

better error message when gpib_config has not been run

specifying config file with gpib_config --file can cause problems,
since library doesn't know anything about it unless IB_CONFIG
is set in the environment as well.  Should warn about this somewhere.
