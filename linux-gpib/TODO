cleanup and improve organization of code - lots of work to do here

add support for chip-specific enhancements to generic nec7210/tms9914 support

generally make this software suck less

fix crash on pcmcia card removal when program has board open

fix reporting of read errors

break up huge dependency files so make isn't so slow, convert
#include <> to #include "" where necessary

have library parse dmesg automatically on error

report error when user tries to read/write to interface board which is
bus master

add send_eoi option for config file

check that REN is asserted when it should be

implement newer NI api

fix setting of TIMO status

a kcontrol module for configuring boards might be nice

test/debug parallel poll support

fix parallel poll timeouts

build static version of library, link examples against it

possible problems when autopoll happens without remote enable

online ioctl doesn't need to handle asserting IFC as there is a
seperate ioctl for that, also IFC should happen after remote enable.

fix ibonl( ud, 1 )
timeouts on read/write should handle data that was able to be
received/sent before timeout occurred.

stuck SRQ handling

request immediate rfd holdoff on read/write timeout on boards that support it

catch nec7210 write errors

allow device clear to interrupt cb7210 accel transfers and others
