cleanup and improve organization of code - lots of work to do here

generally make this software suck less

fix crash on pcmcia card removal when program has board open

have library parse dmesg automatically on error

report error when user tries to read/write to interface board which is
bus master

a kcontrol module for configuring boards might be nice

fix parallel poll timeouts

possible problems when autopoll happens without remote enable

timeouts on read/write should handle data that was able to be
received/sent before timeout occurred.

stuck SRQ handling

add query to ibask() for support of IFC events

interface clear seems to clear rfd holdoffs... maybe we should
give up on trying to assert rfd holdoffs?
