cleanup and improve organization of code - lots of work to do here

generally make this software suck less

fix crash on pcmcia card removal when program has board open

have library parse dmesg automatically on error

report error when user tries to read/write to interface board which is
bus master

a kcontrol module for configuring boards might be nice

possible problems when autopoll happens without remote enable

timeouts on read/write should handle data that was able to be
received/sent before timeout occurred.

stuck SRQ handling

add query to ibask() for support of IFC events

fix support parallel poll timeout support (should be hardware-based)

better error message when gpib_config has not been run

specifying config file with gpib_config --file can cause problems,
since library doesn't know anything about it unless IB_CONFIG
is set in the environment as well.  Should warn about this somewhere.

add links to web page (maybe comedi and vimms)

split off parts of library that need libpthread, so we can
provide a pthread free version (that would lack ibwrta(), etc.).
Add pthread_atfork() calls for async io safety.

lock on board online/offline

libgpib_test: add test for serial poll without autopolling

remove devices that time out from autopoll list

add depmod check to configure script

better error on unknown board_type
