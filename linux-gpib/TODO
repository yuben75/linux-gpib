cleanup and improve organization of code - lots of work to do here

generally make this software suck less

fix crash on pcmcia card removal when program has board open

fix reporting of read/write errors and interruption of
read/write on clears

have library parse dmesg automatically on error

report error when user tries to read/write to interface board which is
bus master

a kcontrol module for configuring boards might be nice

test/debug parallel poll support

fix parallel poll timeouts

build static version of library, link examples against it

possible problems when autopoll happens without remote enable

online ioctl doesn't need to handle asserting IFC as there is a
seperate ioctl for that, also IFC should happen after remote enable.

timeouts on read/write should handle data that was able to be
received/sent before timeout occurred.

stuck SRQ handling

add query to ibask() for support of IFC events
